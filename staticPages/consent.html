            <h3>1. Purpose and Goal of this Research</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of this study is to investigate physiological
              indicators as predictors of users' privacy awareness. The goal of
              this study is to identify physiological markers that can reliably
              predict users' levels of privacy awareness. Your participation
              will help us achieve this goal. The results of this research may
              be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published
              in scientific proceedings and journals.

            <h3>2. Participation and Compensation</h3>
            <p>
              Your participation in this user study is completely voluntary. You
              will be one of approximately 10â€“12 people being tested for this
              research. You will receive 1 EUR as compensation for your
              participation. You may withdraw and discontinue participation at
              any time without penalty or losing the compensation. If you
              decline to participate or withdraw from the user study, no one on
              the campus will be told. The investigator may withdraw you from
              this research if continued participation will not meet the study
              goals or affect your well-being.

            <h3>3. Procedure</h3>
            <p>
              After confirming the informed consent the procedure is as follows:

              <p>
                1. Filling out a demographics form<br />2. Calibrating the eye
                tracker and attaching sensors to your hands<br />3. Browsing the
                web for a few minutes to get used to the setting<br />4.
                Completing the task involving a booking website<br />5. Filling
                out a questionnaire about your experience with the website
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The complete procedure of this user study will last approximately
              30.

            <h3>4. Risks and Benefits</h3>
            <p>
              There are no risks associated with this user study. Discomforts or
              inconveniences will be minor and are not likely to happen. If any
              discomforts become a problem, you may discontinue your
              participation. In order to minimize any risk of infection, hygiene
              regulations of the Humboldt University of Berlin apply and must be
              followed. Any violations of the hygiene regulations or house rules
              of this institution can mean immediate termination of the study.
              If you get injured as a direct result of participation in this
              research, please reach out to the principal investigator. Enrolled
              students are automatically insured against the consequences of
              accidents through statutory accident insurance and with private
              liability insurance in case of any damages. The confirmation of
              participation in this study can be obtained directly from the
              researchers.

            <h3>5. Data Protection and Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>
              We are planning to publish our results from this and other
              sessions in scientific articles or other media. These publications
              will neither include your name nor cannot be associated with your
              identity. Any demographic information will be published anonymized
              and in aggregated form. Contact details (such as e-mails) can be
              used to track potential infection chains or to send you further
              details about the research. Your contact details will not be
              passed on to other third parties. Any data or information obtained
              in this user study will be treated confidentially, will be saved
              encrypted, and cannot be viewed by anyone outside this research
              project unless we have you sign a separate permission form
              allowing us to use them. All data you provide in this user study
              will be subject of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
              of the European Union (EU) and treated in compliance with the
              GDPR. Faculty and administrators from the campus will not have
              access to raw data or transcripts. This precaution will prevent
              your individual comments from having any negative repercussions.
              During the study, we log experimental data, record data of your
              eye movements, take physiological measurements of your body,
              record the screen and/or activities on your device, and take notes
              during the user study. Raw data and material will be retained
              securely and compliance with the GDPR, for no longer than
              necessary or if you contact the researchers to destroy or delete
              them immediately. As with any publication or online-related
              activity, the risk of a breach of confidentiality or anonymity is
              always possible. According to the GDPR, the researchers will
              inform the participant if a breach of confidential data was
              detected.

              will be anonymized and cannot be associated with my name. I
              understand that full anonymity cannot be guaranteed and a breach
              of confidentiality is always possible. From the consent of
              publication, I cannot derive any rights (such as any explicit
              acknowledgment, financial benefit, or co-authorship). I understand
              that the material can be published worldwide and may be the
              subject of a press release linked to social media or other
              promotional activities. Before publication, I can revoke my
              consent at any time. Once the material has been committed to
              publication it will not be possible to revoke the consent.
