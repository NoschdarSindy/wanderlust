## **üîπ Deceptive Design (Experimental Conditions)**
Each **stimulus must exist in three conditions**:
1. **Deceptive Design Mode** (Uses dark patterns)
2. **Fair Design Mode** (No manipulative design)
3. **No Stimulus Mode** (The UI element is absent)

Each stimulus should be implemented as **a separate React component**, allowing it to dynamically switch between conditions.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Geolocation Permission (Nagging & Privacy Zuckering)**

   - **Fair Mode:** The checkbox is unchecked by default.
   - **No Stimulus:** No travel protection plan is offered.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Payment Information (Forced Action)**
